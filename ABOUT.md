In This application as described well in the problem 

**Arduino function to control one input and output (IO Pins)
  the input pin is a switch as interrupt once it pressed it should lighting the led connected to output pin.

**if the switch pressed must send “pressed” to the serial monitor only one time also send the LED states ”ON” or “OFF”

**the whole function could be used many times in the program without interfering each-other
** send continuous serial date comes from temperature sensor with 3 second rate .at the same time

Starting with 

1- Search 

As usual i like always to start with search about the problem and the tool , unfortunatuliy i don't have a cable for my arduino so i want to find an online (TinkerCad) src or offline (codeBlocks Ardunio Builder) .

I prefer  to work on online tool as i easy and very Obvious to handel.


2-Problem Illustration 

Read the problem well and define Input and output of the system and what functions i need to build this app.

3-implementation

write down function needed and build the circuit on tinkercard to test . 

Problems 

i don't know the meaning of "the whole function could be used many times in the program without interfering each-other"
and i use a delay that freeze the program , then i know about millis(); taht solve this problem make the program more flexiable and run in a good manner .



I choose to use arduino (i know c well and handling with tiva c using keil but i don't have the board ) As i good method with a lot of library and many of online Tutorial to help if i need help .
I use ardunio previously in some workshops and project as (smart home prototype using keypad ,servo motor ,leds and with mobile app) so but i start read some examples to remember function and dealinig with it . but it is a good experiance to work with ardunio again .

i use tinkercad to test my code and check the output .
